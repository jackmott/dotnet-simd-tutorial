# What are intrinsics? Why intrinsics?

## Motivation 1: Inline assembler is hard for compilers
* Supporting inline assembler is hard for compiler writers *(MSVC no longer supports it at all)*
* Inline assembler can cause performance degredation in surrounding code. The compiler is working hard to reason about optimal register use and now you have *ruined everything* (maybe)

## Motivation 2: Inline assembler is hard for humans
* Manage registers by hand!

## Intrinsics
* Look like normal function calls
* Tells the compiler "please emit this machine instruction"
* Programmer doesn't have to worry about registers
* Compiler can reason about registers more easily
* You can still sometimes beat intrinsics by large margins with inline assembler! https://danluu.com/assembly-intrinsics/
* Intel has a handy guide https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/
